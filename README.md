# cycle-gans-unpaired
This project is the implementation of the [cycle gans paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593) using unpaired images.

Code can be found in the notebooks folder, the code was written in Tensorflow 1.15, and tested on the following pair: 

* Apple and Oranges
* Scenery

An example of the results obtained for this implementation can be found in the results folder. Datasets for both can be downloaded [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~taesung_park/CycleGAN/datasets/)
